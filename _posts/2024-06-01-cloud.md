# Road to Cloud Engineer

**Foundational Knowledge:**
1. **Linux Basics:** Start with understanding Linux commands, file system, permissions, and basic scripting.
2. **Networking Fundamentals:** Learn about TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and basic network troubleshooting.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Fundamentals:** Get familiar with GCP services, especially Compute Engine, Cloud Logging, Kubernetes Engine, and Cloud Automation (e.g., Cloud Functions).

**Intermediate Level:**
1. **Syslog Analysis:** Understand syslog formats, log rotation, log shipping, and aggregation techniques.
2. **Docker Fundamentals:** Learn about containerization, Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, and basic Docker commands.
3. **Kubernetes Basics:** Dive into Kubernetes concepts like pods, deployments, services, and how they relate to your deployment infrastructure.

**Advanced Topics:**

1. **Automation:** Explore tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Google Cloud Deployment Manager for infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.
2. **Kubernetes Orchestration:** Learn advanced Kubernetes topics like Persistent Volumes, StatefulSets, RBAC, and Helm charts.
Log Analysis Tools: Dive deeper into log analysis tools and techniques, including ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Google Cloud's Logging and Monitoring tools.

**Practical Projects:**
- **Build a Logging Pipeline:** Create a logging pipeline using Google Cloud Logging to collect, analyze, and visualize syslogs from Compute Engine instances.
- **Containerize Applications:** Dockerize your applications and deploy them on Kubernetes Engine for better scalability and management.
- **Automate Infrastructure Deployment:** Develop automation scripts or templates to deploy and manage your infrastructure on GCP using tools like Terraform or Deployment Manager.
- **Kubernetes Deployment and Scaling:** Deploy applications on Kubernetes, implement auto-scaling, rolling updates, and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Security and Compliance:** Implement security best practices for logging, containerization, and Kubernetes, and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.

**Continuous Learning:**
- **Stay Updated:** Keep up with the latest developments in cloud computing, containerization, and DevOps practices through blogs, forums, and conferences.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Regularly work on new projects, participate in hackathons, or contribute to open-source projects related to your field of interest.
- **Certifications:** Consider pursuing relevant certifications such as Google Cloud Certified - Professional Cloud Architect, Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), or Certified Docker Associate to validate your skills and knowledge.

Remember, practical experience and hands-on projects are key to mastering these technologies. Start with small projects and gradually move to more complex ones as you gain confidence and expertise.

# Linux Basics

The following will detail basic commands of Linux.


1. **Which option with the command "rm" is required to remove a directory?**
- -d
- -f
- -r
- -i

To remove a directory using the rm command, you typically need to use the `-r` or `--recursive` option. This option allows `rm` to recursively remove directories and their contents.

So, the command to remove a directory would be:
```
rm -r directory_name
```

Make sure to use this command with caution, as it will remove the specified directory and all its contents permanently.

---

2. **The command used to display the manual pages for any command is**

- man
- manual
- help
- show

The command used to display the manual pages for any command is `man`.

For example, to display the manual page for the `ls` command, you would type:

```
man ls
```

This will open up the manual page for ls within your terminal, allowing you to view detailed information about its usage, options, and examples.

---

3. **Which of following will show the first 5 lines of the input file**

- less -5 file
- head -5 file
- more -5 file
- show -5 file

To display the first 5 lines of an input file, you can use several commands in Unix-like systems. Here are some common ones:

**head:** This command displays the first few lines of a file. By default, it shows the first 10 lines, but you can specify the number of lines with the `-n` option.

```
head -n 5 filename
```

**sed:** You can use `sed` (stream editor) to print the first 5 lines.

```
sed -n 1,5p filename
```

**awk:** Similarly, `awk` can be used to print the first 5 lines.

```
awk 'NR <= 5' filename
```

All of these commands will output the first 5 lines of the input file named filename. Choose the one that suits your preferences or is available in your environment.

---

4. **Which option of "ls" will show the hidden files**

- -h
- -a
- -l
- -i

The option of the `ls` command that shows hidden files is `-a` or `--all`. 

So, to display hidden files along with other files in a directory, you would use:

```
ls -a
```

This will list all files, including hidden files and directories, in the current directory.

---

5. **The command "cat -n file" will**

- Add a new line after every line of the output
- Add line numbers to every line of the output
- Will show only a count of number of lines in the file.
- Will not print any thing.

The command "cat -n file" will display the contents of the file with line numbers prepended to each line. 

For example, if you have a file named "file" with the following content:

```
Hello
World
```

Running the command "cat -n file" would output:

```
 1  Hello
 2  World
```

The `-n` option with the `cat` command numbers all output lines, starting at 1.

---

6. **The command "echo -n hello" will**

- Print "hello" and add a new line after it
- Not print any thing
- Print "hello" and not add a new line after it
- Change the case and print HELLO

The command "echo -n hello" will print the string "hello" to the terminal without a trailing newline character.

So, if you run:

```
echo -n hello
```

You'll get:

```
hello
```

But without the newline character at the end.

---

7. **The command sort by default sorts**

- Text
- Numbers
- Any thing
- Special symbols

The `sort` command by default sorts the lines of text files in ascending alphabetical order, treating each line as a single unit.

For example, if you have a file with the following lines:

```
banana
apple
grape
```

Running the `sort` command without any options:

```bash
sort filename
```

Would output:

```
apple
banana
grape
```

Alphabetically sorted in ascending order.

---

8. **Which of the following will list the users who currently logged in in the system**

- login
- which
- who
- tty

The command that lists the users who are currently logged in on the system is:

```bash
who
```

This command displays information about users who are currently logged in, including their usernames, terminal, login time, and remote hostname or IP address if applicable.

---

9. **To change the password of a user we can use the command**

- password
- passwd
- chpass
- su

To change the password of a user, you can use the `passwd` command. Here's the general syntax:

```bash
passwd username
```

Replace `username` with the name of the user whose password you want to change. After executing this command, you will be prompted to enter and confirm the new password for the specified user.

---

10. **Which command can be used to view the content of a file in reverse i.e from last line to first.**

- cat -r
- rev
- tac
- less

To view the content of a file in reverse, you can use the `tac` command, which stands for "reverse cat". It displays the lines of a file in reverse order, from the last line to the first.

Here's how you can use it:

```bash
tac filename
```

This command will display the content of the file `filename` in reverse order, with the last line appearing first and the first line appearing last.
