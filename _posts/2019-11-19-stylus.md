### What is Stylus?

Stylus is an extension for your browser where it can allow you to edit the visual styling of websites. It also has a lot of styles for download other users created which you can find by clicking Find styles. A similiar extension that a lot used to use was Stylish[[0]](https://robertheaton.com/2018/08/16/stylish-is-back-and-you-still-shouldnt-use-it/)[[1]](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/stylish-extension-with-2m-downloads-banished-for-tracking-every-site-visit/), but that was found to be tracking users and ultimately killed.

Anyways this is a rundown on how to get started and how you could use Stylus. Maybe you want a Dark Theme for HackerNews? What about moving some element on a website you use to make it easier to navigate through? _Create your own prefered user experience._

### After Install
Once the extension is added to your browser, left click the icon. You have a couple options, `turning all styles off`, `finding styles` other users created, a button for `inline` to display the results of the previous: finding styles, then `write styles for this, and a link to the current page`, as well as buttons for `manage, options, and wiki`.

The ones I frequently use is, turning off all styles: to toggle edits that I've made to see how I could improve them better without getting distracted by the current edits. And also the link that says `Write Styles for:` The cool thing about this link below this is that it is hoverable, you can hover the far right and it will create a style for the current page: `this URL`. Otherwise, you can click the begining part of the link and create a global style for the entire website. When deciding which one is better for you, first figure out what you want to do and how it might effect the other parts of the website that you might use all the time.
