### What is Stylus?

Stylus is an extension for your browser where it can allow you to edit the CSS styling of websites. It also has a lot of user style where other people editing their favorite websites and it allows you to install those styles. The extension I used to use was Stylish, but that was found to be tracking users and ultimately killed.
